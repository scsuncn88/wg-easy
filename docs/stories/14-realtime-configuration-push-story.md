# User Story: Real-time Configuration Push to Network Nodes

## Story
As an administrator, I want all configuration changes made through the web interface to be instantly pushed to all relevant nodes so that my SD-WAN network immediately reflects the updated policies and maintains consistent network behavior across all nodes.

## Business Value
This story enables administrators to have immediate effect of their configuration changes across the entire network without requiring manual intervention on individual nodes. It's a critical requirement for maintaining network consistency and responsiveness in a distributed SD-WAN environment. Real-time configuration push ensures that security policies, routing changes, and network topology updates are uniformly applied across all nodes, reducing the risk of inconsistent network behavior and security vulnerabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When an administrator makes any configuration change through the web interface, the change is immediately propagated to all relevant nodes
2. Configuration updates are delivered securely and reliably to nodes via the WebSocket management channel
3. Nodes successfully apply configuration updates and acknowledge receipt to the management service
4. Failed configuration pushes are automatically retried with appropriate backoff strategy
5. Configuration changes are versioned and tracked for audit purposes
6. Nodes can handle multiple rapid configuration updates without conflicts or data corruption
7. Rollback mechanism allows reverting to previous configuration versions when needed
8. Real-time status of configuration push operations is visible in the management interface
9. Configuration push operations are logged for audit and troubleshooting purposes

## Technical Implementation Details
- Implement configuration change detection in the management service:
  - Database triggers or event listeners to detect configuration changes
  - Configuration change event queue for processing
  - Change aggregation to minimize redundant pushes
- Enhance WebSocket management channel for configuration delivery:
  - Event: `config_update` - Contains full or incremental configuration changes
  - Event: `config_ack` - Node acknowledgment of successful configuration application
  - Event: `config_error` - Node reporting of configuration application failures
- Configuration serialization and delivery:
  - Serialize configuration data in JSON format for transmission
  - Implement delta-based updates to minimize bandwidth usage
  - Support for full configuration refresh when needed
- Node-side configuration application:
  - Configuration validation before application
  - Atomic configuration updates to prevent partial application
  - Rollback mechanism to previous working configuration on failure
  - Configuration persistence to local storage
- Security implementation:
  - Configuration data encryption in transit
  - Configuration data integrity verification using checksums
  - Access control to ensure only authorized changes are pushed
  - Audit logging of all configuration changes and push operations
- Error handling and reliability:
  - Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed pushes
  - Dead letter queue for repeatedly failed configuration pushes
  - Alerting mechanism for persistent configuration push failures
  - Graceful degradation when nodes are temporarily unavailable
- Database integration:
  - Store configuration versions with timestamps and author information
  - Track configuration push status for each node
  - Maintain configuration history for rollback capability
- Management interface enhancements:
  - Real-time display of configuration push status
  - Configuration version history and rollback options
  - Detailed logging of configuration push operations

## Dependencies
- WebSocket management channel must be fully implemented and operational
- Node agent must support receiving and applying configuration updates
- Database schema must support configuration versioning and tracking
- Authentication and authorization systems must validate configuration changes
- Network infrastructure must support reliable WebSocket communication

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests for configuration change detection and event generation
- Integration tests for end-to-end configuration push workflow
- Load tests to ensure system can handle multiple simultaneous configuration changes
- Security tests for configuration data encryption and access control
- Resilience tests for configuration push retry mechanisms
- Performance tests for configuration serialization and delivery
- Validation tests for node-side configuration application and rollback
- End-to-end tests simulating real-world configuration change scenarios
- Stress tests for configuration push to large numbers of nodes
